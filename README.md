# Frontend Engineering Challenge - Color Code Breaker


## Game Rules

The purpose of the game is for the user to try and guess a code. When a new game is started (by clicking "Start New Game"), a code of 5 color blocks is randomly generated (not shown to user) and a timer is started. The user then selects a color for each block of the code and "checks" their answer by clicking "Guess". If they guessed right, they are notified and told how many guesses it took them and how long it took them. If they didn't get the entire code right, they are able to guess again. The user should be able to see a list of previous guesses. This list of previous guesses should also display which blocks they guessed correctly (up to you how this is displayed). A user can guess unlimited number of times until they get the code right. Starting a new game removes old guesses, generates a new code, and restarts the timer. They should not be able to score a "guess" unless they have started a game and the timer is running.
